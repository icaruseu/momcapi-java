MOM-CA API
==========

This is an API to access and modify the data in a [MOM-CA Database](https://github.com/icaruseu/mom-ca).

Usage
-----

1. Create a `connection.properties` file on classpath with the following properties:
```
    connectionType=exist
    connectionUrl=xmldb:exist://[momca-url]/xmlrpc
    user=admin
    password=[momca-password]
```
2. Get a connection factory and momca connection:
```
MomcaConnectionFactory factory = new MomcaConnectionFactory();
MomcaConnection momca = factory.getMomcaConnection();
```
       
3. Use the various *manager* classes, e.g. `CharterManager`, provided by MomcaConnection to access and modify data:
```
CharterManager cm = momca.getCharterManager();
```

4. Do something with it. For instance, the following snippet gets a list of the ids of the charters of a specific fond:
```
List<IdCharter> charterIds = cm.list(new IdFond("AT-StiASei", "SeitenstettenOSB"))
```

Tests
-----

To run the unit tests, a new MOM-CA instance must be created and the backup data in `/src/test/resources/test_database_backup.zip` needs to be restored.
